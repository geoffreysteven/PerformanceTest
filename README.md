# Performance Testing

### Simple MLP for timing on CPU vs GPU
---
Based on the outstanding books by Brown Lee at:

www.MachineLearningMastery.com

Specifically the Deep Learning book and the 
pima-indians-diabetes public dataset:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes

To use:

	jupyter notebook MLP_Basic.ipynb  
  

I suggest using with Tensorboard and ipython's %time.

Enjoy!
